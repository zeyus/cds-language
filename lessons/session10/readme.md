# Session 10 - Using BERT-style models via ```HuggingFace```

## Overview

Over the course of this semester, we've been introduced to the core NLP libraries for doing cultural data science. We've seen ```pandas``` and ```numpy```; ```spaCy``` and ```gensim```; and we've worked with ```scikit-learn``` and ```TensorFlow```. This week we're working with last of the core libraries that are worth learning for our purposes - ```HuggingFace```.

Today, we'll see how ```HuggingFace``` pipelines allow us to use pretrained transformers to do interesting information extraction on our data, and to perform high-level tasks like text generation and summarization.

We'll see how to perform a number of these tasks, before getting starting on [Assignment 4](https://classroom.github.com/a/BhnScEmU).

## Tasks

- Introducing the ```HuggingFace``` universe
- Working with pipelines
- Introducing and working on Assignment 4
